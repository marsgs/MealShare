                <p>Help feed your community by donating ready to eat or other fresh foods. If your family has leftovers
                    to spare, don't just throw it away! Donate it to Meal Share so that a person in need can have a meal
                    at a small cost. It is as easy as simply dropping off the food at one of the locations shown on the
                    map.</p>

                <p>Not just indiviual community members can participate, businesses in the food industry can donate too.
                    If your restaurant or other food business has excess fresh food that goes to waste, donate it! It
                    can also be written off as a tax deduction so on top of being an eco-friendly and thoughtful action.
